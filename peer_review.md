1. **Clarity & Organization** 
- The notebook is well-organized with clearly numbered sections and headings that guide the reader through each step of the project. The layout, along with the use of charts and explanations, makes it very easy to follow.

1. **Feature Selection & Justification**
- He chose a good target variable with mpg, which makes sense for understanding car efficiency. The input features—weight, model year, and make are relevant and likely to impact mpg, making them solid choices for the model.

1. **Model Performance & Comparisons**
- He found that the baseline linear regression model slightly outperformed both pipeline models, showing that his features were already well-prepared. Scaling didn’t improve results, and adding polynomial features reduced performance due to overfitting.

1. **Reflection Quality** 
- His reflections are clear and show good understanding. He learned that simple models can work really well, and talked about the challenges of working with messy data and categories. He also shared useful ideas for what to try next.
